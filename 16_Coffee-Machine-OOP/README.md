# ☕ Coffee Machine Project - OOP Version
> A simple Python console program that simulates a coffee vending machine.
Users can order drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino), insert coins, and receive their beverage if sufficient resources and payment are available. The machine can also generate a report of its current resources and be turned off by maintainers.

This project behaves same as day 15, but this is coded differently, using OOP.
The goal of this project was to write the main.py using the **classes already defined by my teacher in the modules coffee_maker, menu, money_machine files**.
