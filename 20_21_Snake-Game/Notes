Steps to solve the problem:
1. Create a snake body - 3 segments in sq, square size is 20X20
2. Move the snake - Continuously move snake forward automatically
3. Control the snake - Up, Down, Left, Right, and not allow back and forth movement
4. Detect collision with food - hit a piece of food, blue circle 10 X 10, everytime it touches the food,
   distance between snake head and food is less than 15 pixels, the food should move to a random location on the screen
5. Create a scoreboard - using a method called write.
6. Detect collision with wall - considering the boundary as 560 X 560 as the screen is 600 X 600
7. Detect collision with tail - increasing the snake body when it eats food,
    and end game when it collides with its own tail
