## 🚀 Enhancement — Convert to EXE (Personal Calculator App)

Take your Python Calculator to the next level by converting it into a standalone .exe application!
This allows you to run it without opening Python or a terminal — just like any regular Windows app.
You can even pin it to your desktop or taskbar for quick access, or share it with friends.

See the PY_to_EXE file in the main folder for the steps to convert to application.
