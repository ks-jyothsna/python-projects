# 🪒 Secret Auction

>> A simple Python console project that simulates a **secret auction** where multiple participants can place bids. At the end, the program determines and displays the highest bidder along with their bid amount.

## 🧩 Features/Logic

- Each participant enters their **name** and **bid amount**.
- After each bid, the program asks if there are other participants:
- If **yes**, the screen is cleared (by printing multiple blank lines) and the next bidder can enter their details.
- If **no**, the auction ends and the winner is determined.
- All bids are stored in a **dictionary** with names as keys and bids as values.
- The program then calculates and displays:
  - The **highest bid**
  - The **name of the winning bidder**
