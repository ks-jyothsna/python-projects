# 🔠 Caeser Cipher

> This is a simple Python console program that demonstrates message encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
The user can act as both Sender and Receiver in the same console — first encoding a message, then decoding it to verify the result.

## 🏛️ Brief History

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to send secret military messages.
It works by shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions — for example, with a shift of 3, A → D, B → E, and so on.
Though easily broken by modern standards, it’s a classic example of substitution cipher and a great way to learn the basics of cryptography and programming logic.

🧩 Caesar Cipher Console App
💡 Overview
This is a simple Python console program that demonstrates message encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
The user can act as both Sender and Receiver in the same console — first encoding a message, then decoding it to verify the result.

⚙️ Features
Encrypts and decrypts messages using Caesar Cipher logic
User chooses whether to encode or decode
Runs completely in the console (no external files needed)
Great for beginners learning about strings and loops in Python

🧠 How It Works

The program asks the user whether they want to encode or decode a message.
The user enters a message and a shift value (number of letters to move).
The program returns the encoded or decoded message.
The user can choose to continue or exit.
