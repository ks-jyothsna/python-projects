# 🔠 Caeser Cipher

> This is a simple Python console program that demonstrates message encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
The user can act as both Sender and Receiver in the same console — first encoding a message, then decoding it to verify the result.

## 🏛️ Brief History

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to send secret military messages.
It works by shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions — for example, with a shift of 3, A → D, B → E, and so on.
Though easily broken by modern standards, it’s a classic example of substitution cipher and a great way to learn the basics of cryptography and programming logic.
  
## 🧠 How It Works
- The program asks the user whether they want to encode or decode a message.
- The user enters a message
- The user enters a shift value (number of letters to move).
- The code is made simple by using a single function to encode and decode message.
- The program shifts the letters to the specific shift in the alphabet list.
- Spaces, symbols and special characters are not encrypted, they are kept as it is.
- The program returns the encoded or decoded message.
- The user can act as receiver to type the same encoded message with the same shift value to verify the message
- The user can choose to continue or exit.
