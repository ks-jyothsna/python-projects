# 🔠 Caeser Cipher

> This is a simple Python console program that demonstrates message encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
The user can act as both Sender and Receiver in the same console — first encoding a message, then decoding it to verify the result.

## 🕰️ Story behind the Ceaser Cipher 

- In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used  in his private correspondence to send highly sensitive military messages

💡 Overview

This is a simple Python console program that demonstrates message encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
The user can act as both Sender and Receiver in the same console — first encoding a message, then decoding it to verify the result.

⚙️ Features

Encrypts and decrypts messages using Caesar Cipher logic

User chooses whether to encode or decode

Runs completely in the console (no external files needed)

Great for beginners learning about strings and loops in Python

🧠 How It Works

The program asks the user whether they want to encode or decode a message.

The user enters a message and a shift value (number of letters to move).

The program returns the encoded or decoded message.

The user can choose to continue or exit.
