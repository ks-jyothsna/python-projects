# ☕ Coffee Machine Project
> A simple Python console program that simulates a coffee vending machine.
Users can order drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino), insert coins, and receive their beverage if sufficient resources and payment are available. The machine can also generate a report of its current resources and be turned off by maintainers.
