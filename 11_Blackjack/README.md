# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python Console Project)

> A simple Python console-based Blackjack game where a player competes against the computer (dealer).
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, following standard Blackjack rules.

## 🎮 Gameplay Rules
- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1 if the sum goes beyond 21.
- Use the following list as the deck of cards:
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
- The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.
